Chohan
======

It's a simple game with simple rules. 

Cho-Han Bakuchi (or Cho Ka Han Ka, or simply Cho-Han) is a traditional Japanese gambling game using dice.

The game uses two standard six-sided dice, which are shaken in a bamboo cup or bowl by a dealer. The cup 
is then overturned onto the floor. Players then place their wagers on whether the sum total of numbers 
showing on the two dice will be "Cho" (even) or "Han" (odd). The dealer then removes the cup, displaying
the dice. The winners collect their money.

In this situation should no player get a winning bet, then the money is considered lost (that money can
be thought of as given to the house). Should at least one player win, that player will collect the money
from all losing bets. It is possible for everyone to win, thus after that round the player's balances
are unaffected. You can choose to play a round or skip the round.

In this version of the game, you win when your opponents have no money left (this is easily done by 
passing every round, but what's the fun in that). The goal of this version is to see how much money you 
come away with before the other players lose their money (which could possibly never happen).
